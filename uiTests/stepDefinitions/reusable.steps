Steps: Some reusable steps

  Step: I am on the courgette homepage
    Given I am on the page with url '/'
    And I set the cookie 'MCPopupClosed' with value 'yes'
    And I set the cookie 'privacyPolicyAgreed' with value 'true'
    And I am on the page with url '/'
    When I click the element that contains the text 'Get started'

  Step: I should be able to access the get started page
    Then I expect the url to contain 'courgette-testing.com/getting-started'
    Then take a screenshot
