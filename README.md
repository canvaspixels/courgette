## Courgette gives you:

* a load of [generic step definitions](http://courgette-testing.com/step-definitions) for you to begin writing Given When Then scenarios that will run as soon as you add the CSS or XPath selectors to the .page (YAML) file
* snippets or live templates for intellisense in your favourite IDE to write those steps accurately and quickly
* [Courgette API](http://courgette-testing.com/api) for creating your own step definitions
* screenshots on error for debugging
* a step for named screenshots
* an HTML report
* a Cucumber formatter for nice output in the terminal
* a Cucumber formatter for step definition usage
* an error report summary in the terminal output
* Windows, Mac, Linux support
* ability to DRY out selectors with .component (YAML) files
* ability to run against cloud services that provide a selenium grid
* ability to easily create true [BDD user stories](http://courgette-testing.com/bdd)
